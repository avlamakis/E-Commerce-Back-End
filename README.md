## Description:
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

In this link I showcase how the App operates via Insomnia showing the following:

A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the e-commerce back end must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to create the schema from the MySQL shell.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to seed the database from the command line.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the applicationâ€™s server.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.
